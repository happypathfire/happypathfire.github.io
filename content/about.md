> Hi there! I'm Laks. I love to see positive change in the world. Like you, I am trying to do my tiny bit to help the best way I can.
> 
> One of the few things that I love is Finance. Investing in particular. Through this site I try to share the Knowledge I have acquired over a long time and over many painful experiences so that you don't have to go through the same.
> 
> I believe that happiness is the right of every sentient being. Happiness should not be a reward after a life of suffering in a difficult path but rather there should be happiness along the path. True Happiness _is possible only through freedom - both Physical and Mental._
> 
> The single goal of all the contents of this site are to help you achieve **Freedom** which in today's world depends a lot on **Financial Freedom**. Through this blog I try to show a way to achieve this the Easy, Fast and Safe way.
> 
> I wish you all the success and happiness on your FIRE journey. Happy path FIRE!
